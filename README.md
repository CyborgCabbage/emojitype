# Emoji Type
Emoji Type is a Minecraft 1.18.1 Fabric mod that allows you to easily enter emoji into text fields by typing a specific key word (e.g. :skull:). You can send emojis on a server without the server or other players needing to have the mod installed.

P.S. Thank you to LlamaLad7 on the Fabric discord server for helping me with some mixin stuff, very cool.
